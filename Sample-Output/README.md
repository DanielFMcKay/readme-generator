## Description
This project is a weekly assignment for the Bootcamp Spot coding bootcamp offered through UC Berkeley. It is a ReadMe file generator that uses command line prompts via Node JS to get relevant information from the User and then insert them into a professional ReadMe which it then produces in a folder designated by the User.

## Installation Instructions
First, copy the files and folders in this repository, put them in a folder. Then use a code terminal to navigate to it. Then type "npm i inquirer" to install a node_modules file (this folder is ONLY for local use, do NOT export it!). Then you can run the app with the command line "node index."

## Usage
