# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

* This app is week 9 assignment for the UC Berkeley Bootcamp Spot coding bootcamp. 

* It is a README generator that prompts a user for input via command lines in a terminal using Node JS, and then inputs the information into a professionally formatted ReadMe.

* It contains a title, license badge, author name, a table of contents with anchor links to sections for Description, Installation, Usage, the Live Site, Contributing, Tests, Notes, Questions, and License, License, per the assignment instructions.

* A sample output is included in the Sample-Output folder here: https://github.com/DanielFMcKay/readme-generator/tree/master/Sample-Output.

* Demo video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ocL2F_tzDmNd-mlUrmRyqMXWHZ13vQCu/view

* There is a utility folder that has a script file for generating the desired markdown formatting. It will also apply the licensing text and stamp at a future date.

Note: the anchor tags in the provided output sample act as if the file was located where a GitHub ReadMe normally would be. Please click on the Description link to see it link back here to demonstrate.
