## Description
This project is a weekly assignment for the Bootcamp Spot coding bootcamp offered through UC Berkeley. It is a ReadMe file generator that uses command line prompts via Node JS to get relevant information from the User and then insert them into a professional ReadMe which it then produces in a folder designated by the User.

## Installation Instructions
### First, copy the files and folders in this repository, put them in a folder. Then use a code terminal to navigate to it. Then type "npm i inquirer" to install a node_modules file (this folder is ONLY for local use, do NOT export it!). Then you can run the app with the command line "node index."

## Usage
### A demo video will be provided in the future. Ironically, it is being recorded now. Anyway, the app is used by using a coding terminal such as Git Bash or VS Code's integrated terminal, running the command "node index", and then answering each question as prompted, and selecting an appropriate usage license from the list provided or entering a different one.

## Tests
### There are no built-in tests at the moment beyond console logs. However, you can still test the app by running it.
